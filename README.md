# Portofolio
This documentation is for my portofolio. Contains what have I done before as my practice to expert field at Quality Assurance (Manual) or Automation role. This document will be separate by two section, Manual and Automation.

## Manual

### Experience

- Write review for developers almost once per month
- Exploratory Testing, Performance Testing (Benchmarking), Features Testing

### Jira 
I learn Jira as the Bug Management Tools. What have I did before with Jira:

1. PT. Kenali Indah Sejahtera
PT. Kenali Indah Sejahtera (KIS) is a Jambi, Sumatera based company that engaged in the Transportation and Collection of Hazardous Toxic Waste ( Pengangkutan dan Pengumpulan Limbah Bahan Berbahaya Beracun or B3) on a National Scale which already has a permit from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia along with a Special Goods Transport Permit from the Ministry of Transportation of the Republic of Indonesia.

KIS has a static [website](https://kenaliindahsejahtera.com) which to me should have a little bit of touch and fixing to make it more better. I have written some bugs as issues at Jira and already report it to the developer.

Jira issues summary can be seen in image below.

# BIG Note
I am still learning about how to be a great tester, if there's something wrong and you think I have to change or improve it (example: wrong priority or severity labeling, wrong format of bug issue/test case, etc etc.), you can definetely contact me on Discord Kira#1383 for the feedback. Thank you!
