### Jira 
I learn Jira as the Bug Management Tools. What have I did before with Jira:

1. PT. Kenali Indah Sejahtera
PT. Kenali Indah Sejahtera (KIS) is a Jambi, Sumatera based company that engaged in the Transportation and Collection of Hazardous Toxic Waste ( Pengangkutan dan Pengumpulan Limbah Bahan Berbahaya Beracun or B3) on a National Scale which already has a permit from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia along with a Special Goods Transport Permit from the Ministry of Transportation of the Republic of Indonesia.

KIS has an static [website](https://kenaliindahsejahtera.com) which to me should have a little bit of touch and fixing to make it more better. I have written some bugs as issues at Jira and already report it to the developer.
